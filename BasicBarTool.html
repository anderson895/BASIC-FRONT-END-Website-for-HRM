	<i><b>	Bar mats</b></i>

		<p>Bartenders can prepare drinks on bar mats, which can prevent spills and protect the surface of the bar from wet glasses. Made from thick and heavy rubber, these mats provide drainage for any spilled drinks and are easy to pick up and empty into the sink.</p>

			<img src="images/2.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Much the same as bar mats, service mats are where bartenders place drinks that are ready to be delivered to customers by servers. The mats provide stability so there’s less spillage, helping to reduce the cost of waste.</p>

		<i><b>	Bottle opener</i></b>	
			<img src="images/4.jpg" alt="">
			<p>One tool that no bar can do without is a bottle opener. For beer on tap, you won’t need a bottle opener, but you will for any bottled beer or other capped beverages. Consider using openers that are wall-mounted – they’re fast to use and won’t be misplaced behind the bar.</p>
