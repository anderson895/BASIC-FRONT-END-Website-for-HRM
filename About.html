		My name as “Francis”. I am the first child to my parents. I have three brothers and three sisters.<br> I am the elder one among my brothers and sisters. Therefore, all responsibilities of the family lie on my shoulders.
I am 20 years old and studying  at Imperial College of Modern Sciences.I am a self-driven and a self-motivated student. Once my father said to me that “Education is the most powerful weapon, one can conquer all hurdles of life using knowledge”.

I used to take very little interest in my studies, in my early days. My parents used to motivate and encourage me to study but I never understood their cry for my bright future. As it is said that time is the healer and it teaches lessons which none can teach.
		Once I was degraded in front of my father because of lack of interest in studies.

		My near relatives used to project dislike for me as I was the only child in their eyes who showed zero interest in studies.  When people started to disrespect my father and family, declaring us illiterate and ignorant, my inner conscience couldn’t face such severe criticism and degradation.
		I pledged with myself that come what may I would study every waking moment to make my parents respected in the eyes of people.
		I started to read books, with the passage of time reading became my hobby. My curiosity for reading never ceased. it grew and grew and enriched my mind with priceless pearls of knowledge.
		My most absorbing hobby of reading books benefited me a lot in my studies. Unlike many other students I love nature. I wonder watching at plants, animals and birds.Specially during summer and winter vacations I try to establish contact with nature and enjoy being in close communion with nature.
